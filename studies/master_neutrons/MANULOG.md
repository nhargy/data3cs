11:55 | Turned light source on | 
13:24 | restarted server | 
13:24 | restarted notebook ( master_neturons ) |
13:25 | started senso scan | 
21:14 | scan ended
23/09/2023 | SENSO SCAN FAILED | exposure times were not sufficient. will conduct the same run at the end of the study
11:35 | Prism out, ND 4.0 filter out |
11:37 | ZnO_B3_500 in | 
11:40 | started scan | recall: zno ref is a 0.5sec scan, 4 times.

11:59 | failed - restarted | I had the wrong rules inputted 
12:00 | started scan | 
12:02 | I stopped again: exposure of 5sec too long (saturation) | 
12:03 | Changed qz_wl protocol to 0.1, 1 second exposures four times each | 
12:03 | At each point when starting qz_wl again I also restarted the kernel and reinstantiated sys3CS | 
12:03 | started scan | 
12:05 | First background of 600nm corrupt - since the source stayed on. |
