# mono_leakage

**Primary objective:** Characterise the stray light leakage of the monochromator (Horiba Micro HR).

**Secondary objectives:** Understand why the Raman peaks are embedded in other "fluorescence" waves - or is it also the stray light from the monochromator?

## Description
It is known that single monochromators transmitt more stray light than double monochromators. A an order-of-magnitude estimate is usually 10^-5 and 10^-10 supression by single and double monochromators respectively. Our single setup seems to transmit stray light which then gets scattered at different efficiencies by different samples, interfering with the spectrum readouts. In fluorescence spectrometry in general, excitation wavelengths are usually orders of magnitude more intense the the emission by the fluorophores, and it is certainly the case with our setup too. Therefore, some sizeable percentage of the observed colour centre peaks could be just the stray light that made it through both filters.
