**Primary objective**: Characterise the stability of our 5mm x 5mm x 5mm sapphire crystals with respect to their intrinsic fluorescence, as a test for their possible use as reference measurments.

## Description
One of the strongest sources of uncertainty in any measurements we have taken so far are the natural/imposed fluctutations of the crystal fluorescence. For example, even after correcting for background and power fluctuations, I am still unable to say with enough confidence  whether changes in signal are due to a real effect from my independent variable (exposure time, annealing, change of orientation etc.)  *or* the very act of measuring (which includes not only the excitation light, but all the systematics around it such as crystal transport, exosure to the lighting of the room, mechanical stress etc.). If I am able to obtain a set of crystals stable enough to be resistant to such natural fluctuations and my uncontrolled systematics, it would be possible to pin down experimental drift and separate it from a real physical effect. By running a long campaign of measurement on candidate sapphire crystals, their stability over a desired time interval can be characterised.
